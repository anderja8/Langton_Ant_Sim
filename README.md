# Langton_Ant_Sim
This is a simple C++ console app that runs a simulation of Langton's Ant, which is a 2D turing machine that you can read more
about on Wikipedia (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Langton%27s_ant).

# Usage
First, ensure you have the g++ compiler installed. Then `git clone` this repo and run `make`. This will create an executable,
langtonAnt.exe, that will run the simulation. Just follow the on-screen instructions from there. Once you are done, `make clean`
will remove the .o and executable files.
